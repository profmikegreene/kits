## Why use Piazza?
Piazza offers a way to build knowledge among the learning community by providing students a chance to teach one another. Questions receive a relatively higher quality answer through group effort, and the answer is easier to find and reference compared to long discussion forum threads. Instructors can easily guide students by either approving answers or contributing their own.
